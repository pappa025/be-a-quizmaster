# Simple Aviation quiz

### Milestone Project 2 - JavaScript Essentials (JS, HTML, CSS)

This is my second Milestone project. 
Project purpose: Presentation of interactive data
In this project, I've build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

I've choosen  the topic of aviation for this project, as I'm flying Single Engine aircraft in a friendly Club at Weston (EIWT) Airport.

## UX

Upon loading, the first quistion presented with multiple choices.

The design is aviation and the questions are aviation themed. The aim of the quiz is to achive most good answers. Behind the quiz I've placed a picture of the instrument panel of a General Aviation aircraft.

## Features

The following is a summary of the features already in place and those that could perhaps be implemented in the future.

### Existing Features

The program goes through of the same questions in the same order and displays on a final page the achived score.

### Features to Implement

Many functions can be built in. As I was checking countless videos and pages about quizes, some of the ideas for the future:
-start page
-on final page showing which answer bad or good
-source questions from external file
-randomize them

## Testing

Page has been tested with code validator and check all links are valid as of 04/05/2022.

For the HTMLs I've tested the code with [Nu HTML checker] (https://validator.w3.org/nu/) with no error result.
The CSS code has been run through the [W3C CSS Validator] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) with no error found.
JavaScript run through of JSHint where all formal errors were addressed.
Lighthouse results were all between 95-100.

### Technologies Used

- [JavaScript] ( https://www.javascript.com/ )
	- For Interactive elements of the web-page

- [HTML5]( https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
	- Used to construct the basic site structure.

- [CSS3]( https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/css#w3c_all)
	- Provides styling for the page and all content.
