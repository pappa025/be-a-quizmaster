Milestone Project 2

This project is the first time when im spreading my wings on the Software Developement world. The aim of this Project is to Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.

I've choosen the topic of aviation for this project, as I'm flying Single Engine aircraft in a friendly Club at Weston (EIWT) Airport. This project summarizes the most important steps how to obtain your PPL (Private Pilot License). I've also made a detailed page of the 3 most common and widely used training aircrafts (C-152, C-172, Piper Warrior). If you've ever been in any General Aviation airport, for sure you've seen few of them! I've collected on the Resources page the most widely used links for daily flight-planning. These links could be very useful in the future as they can be the base of the Club's webpage I'm planning to do.

UX
The webpage divided to three pages, accessible thrugh the Navbar on the top of the page.

Main Screen - main page with pictures about steps how to get your Private License

The design is aviation themed. In the set header i've placed cloudy sky background, behind the page contents I've placed a picture of the instrument panel of a General Aviation aircraft. In the project I've used darkblue background with orange text color to have great contrast and readability.

Features
The following is a summary of the features already in place and those that could perhaps be implemented in the future.

Existing Features
The project consist of the three htmls and the corresponding CSS file. The images has been placed in the assets/images directory. Link to the pages are placed in the Header section of the page. Parts of the pages were positioned using CSS Grid. It was substantial chellenge to learn the concept, but towards the end of the project I've mastered the layout system. Both Header and Footer is set, they don't change while we navigating between the pages.

How to do your PPL page - consist of explanation of 4 main step to get your PPL. Beside the texts there are topic related pictures. corners of each element of the page has curvature, which give nice design to them. As mentioned above darblue background gives great contrast with the orange text for easier readibility. background of the main area is the analogue instrument paner of a Gen Av Aircraft. Header of the page has got a cloud background. Aircrafts - 3 coulmns with a slightly transparent picture showing the 3 most common Gen Aviaation trainers with their performance data and characteristics. Resources - 9 tiles with pictures to the most widely used external links for General Aviation Pilots.

Features to Implement
This page have enourmous improvement opportunity, as my knowledge getting deeper and deeper in software developement, I'm aiming to be the base of the Club's webpage.

Testing
Page has been tested with code validator and check all links are valid as of 03/2022.

For the HTMLs I've tested the code with [Nu HTML checker] (https://validator.w3.org/nu/) with no error result. The CSS code has been run through the [W3C CSS Validator] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) with no error found.
